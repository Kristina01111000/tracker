A javascript project that I initially learned from a course and added more to

To-Do list: 

-switch the circles to ids 

-separate out the html, css, and javascript

-change_color function not working currently, fix it

-add all of the circles into change color function

-maybe set the colors of all the circles to be a designated distance from each other?
