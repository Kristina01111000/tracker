A javascript project that I initially learned from a course and added changes to

To-Do list: 

- switch the circles to ids 
- make a circle class with all the circle css in it

- separate out the html, css, and javascript into separate files

- change_color function not working currently, fix it
  - add all of the circles into change color function
  - maybe set the colors of all the circles to be a designated distance from each other?
    - make an array of colors to be picked from
